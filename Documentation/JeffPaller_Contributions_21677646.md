# Individual Feature Contributions - Jeff Paller

## Feature 1: Light Cycle Movement System

### Description
Implemented the core movement mechanics for the light cycles, including continuous forward motion, directional turning, and trail generation logic. This system forms the foundation of the game's primary interaction model.

### Technical Implementation
The movement system uses a grid-based approach where cycles move at constant speed but can change direction in 90-degree increments. Each cycle leaves a persistent trail that serves as a collision object. Implementation includes:
- Continuous forward movement using Time.deltaTime to ensure consistent speed across different frame rates
- Direction change handling with input validation to prevent 180-degree turns
- Trail generation using LineRenderer component with position tracking

### Video Demonstration

### Relevant Commits
- [hash/link] Initial player movement implementation
- [hash/link] Trail generation and collision detection
- [hash/link] Performance optimization and bug fixes

## Feature 2: 2-Player Mode Implementation

### Description
Developed the 2-Player mode that enables competitive gameplay on the same device. This mode allows two players to compete directly against each other across five different arenas.

### Technical Implementation
The 2-Player mode implementation required creating separate control systems and game states:
- Dual input handling system that processes commands for both players independently
- Separate control schemes with unique key bindings for each player
- Collision detection that distinguishes between player trails
- Independent scoring system that tracks wins for each player

### Relevant Commits
- [hash/link] Initial 2-Player control implementation
- [hash/link] Player distinction and separate scoring
- [hash/link] UI updates for 2-Player mode
